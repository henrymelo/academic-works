# Academic Works – Henry Renaldo de Melo

This repository brings together my academic works and research projects developed throughout my academic and professional career. The materials presented here reflect an interdisciplinary trajectory that connects software engineering, education, technology, and applied research.

I am a senior software engineer with over twenty years of professional experience, working as a software engineer and specialist in mobile platforms, with a strong specialization in the banking and financial sector. Alongside my technical career, I have continuously dedicated myself to educational practices, including teaching computer science courses, developing professional training programs, and creating educational content for corporate universities and industry- and society-oriented learning initiatives, such as biblical studies and music education.

Over time, my professional practice has increasingly intersected with educational issues, particularly regarding how knowledge is mediated, structured, and learned in contemporary contexts. This led me to formally pursue academic research in the field of Education, focusing on pedagogical mediation, learning processes, and the role of technology in educational environments. This repository reflects the consolidation of this trajectory and supports my intention to pursue postgraduate studies in Education.

### MAPEA: Modelo de Análise Preditiva de Estímulos de Aprendizagem (2025)

**Abstract (EN):**  
This paper proposes a hypothetical Predictive Analysis Model of Learning Stimuli [MAPEA] to investigate how creative stimulus variables, such as musical and literary education, may correlate with academic performance. The persistence of high dropout rates and low academic achievement in Brazil suggests an opportunity to explore the transition from descriptive diagnostics to predictive analysis models. The analysis is grounded in the processing of indicators extracted from official databases (INEP, IBGE, SAEB, PISA/OECD) and scientific evidence, testing the hypothesis that traditional indicators, such as age-grade distortion, when integrated with creative stimulus variables, allow for a more precise modeling of student retention. The analyzed data indicate that the presence of creative components may act as a risk mitigation factor and a potential driver of cognitive proficiency. It is concluded that the MAPEA model serves as a tool for prospecting learning scenarios, suggesting that data-driven creative stimulus interventions can contribute to the personalization of learning trajectories.

### Incompatibilidades da Maquina Virtual Java e protocolo Samba no ambiente Unix-like (2017)

**Abstract (EN):**  
This papers exposes the JVM behavior in the use of the SAMBA-CIFS protocol. Understanding that such analysis is necessary in the security aspect of both search objects. However our research is based on experimental theoretical terms. Applications based a Java, for a particular case of using Java applications in the UNIX-LIKE environment.

### Recurso Hídrico na Construção Civil: Direto e Indireto (2016)

**Abstract (EN):**  
This paper presents concepts of strategic management in water resources management in construction. A water management of direct and indirect resources. Water use in the construction and maintenance of the construction site. Indirectly we have the use of water in homes and indirect interest in the hydroelectric energy matrix economy. This in its indirect relationship with the construction industry can be better managed if the architectural design favoring natural light, for example; favoring the economy of such a source. We could include other cases of indirect savings such as solar panels; But in this work we will focus on the impact of water management in construction where as the activities in the civil construction acceleration, our reservoirs decrease. But when the activities in construction decrease our reservoirs stabilize; analyzing periods and rainfall variations..

**Keywords (EN):**  
Construction; water management; Sustainability.

## Objective

This repository aims to make these works publicly available for academic reference, citation, and indexing by search engines such as Google Scholar.

It also serves as an academic portfolio to support curriculum evaluation, research assessment, and applications to postgraduate programs in Education.
